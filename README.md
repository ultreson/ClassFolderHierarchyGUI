# ClassFolderHierarchyGUI
A C# version of a [previous project](https://github.com/ultreson/ClassFolderHierarchy) I made after learning the basics of the language.

It was originally made in the spring of 2016.

It was used in [this project](https://github.com/PierreOlivierBrillant/GlobalCollege) as well.
